Install python dependencies. Depending on your environment, they maybe already installed
```
emojis
matplotlib
nltk
numpy
pandas
textstat
scipy
sklearn
vaderSentiment
tweepy
```
You should be able to run a command like `$ pipenv install ` and have your installer tool install from the `Pipfile`. Your milage may vary depending on your machine and local Python environment.

Obtain the [data](https://dataverse.mpi-sws.org/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5072/FK2/ZDTEMN). To run the program, you will need to fix 3 errors that will prompt you to input some variables, specific to your system and data. This would be you input file, and the keys for Twitter. Run the `twitter_extractor.py` program to obtain tweet text and other details.

Run main_ml.py
Inside `main_ml.py` you should see a section in there in the top 60 lines, where configuration variables can be set. This program expects the input file from the last step to be called `outfile.csv` This changes what kind of features the program uses to bulid the models. The program will output confusion matrices and classification reports into the `plots` and `classif_reports` directories.

There is also the project_paper directory. It is used to build my report, using `make`. `The main_ml.py` program should be run before creating the report, as the report relies on some files generated by the other program. 

The report's make commands are `paper`, `appendix`, `tex`, `tex2pdf`, and `clean`. pandoc and pandoc-include should be on your system to make the paper.
